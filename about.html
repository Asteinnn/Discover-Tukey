            <p>If you're visiting Cankiri, the Salt Cave is definitely worth a visit. It's located about 20 kilometers
                east of the city, and when you arrive, you'll be greeted by one of the world's largest rifts.
                This incredible cave has huge potential for alternative tourism opportunities and should be recognized
                as a World Health Tourism site. The temperature inside the cave remains a constant 15 degrees, making it
                a great place to escape the heat on hot summer days.
                One section of the cave has been turned into an exhibit area, where you can see works of art created by
                local students using salt rocks and old railroad equipment. One of the most fascinating exhibits is an
                aged donkey that naturally underwent an embalming process and fell into the well about 250 years ago.
                Recently, a wild rabbit has been added to the exhibit to accompany him.
                The entry hallway is narrow and slightly anatomical, with colored lights and a boardwalk to lead you
                safely into the belly of the beast. Once inside, the space is large but welcoming, with atmospheric
                lighting around the base of the open halls. There are picnic tables set around the walls of the
                multi-chambered interior, inviting people to come and set up camp for a family excursion, rather than
                just a passing visit.

        <h2>MOUNT NEMRUT</h2>

    <div class="cont3">

        <div class="brief2">
            <p>The haunting sculptures overlooking Mount Nemrut are some of the most magnificent that you'll find
                anywhere in the world. Giant heads built in the 1st century B.C. under the Commagene Kingdom look out
                over an incredible sunrise and sunset every day. These massive sculptures are like just about nowhere
                else in the world, weighing at 6 tons and are a full 10 meters tall.
                But where do these mysterious sculptures come from? What is the Commagene Kingdom? Who was King
                Antiochus I Theos? Why were they built? What purpose do they serve? And why on this spot? It’s one of
                the few examples in history where we have the remnants of the history and not the memory, so it’s up to
                us to set the record right and discover the history of this land all over again.
                The mausoleum of Antiochus I (69–34 B.C.), who reigned over Commagene, a kingdom founded north of Syria and the Euphrates after the breakup of Alexander's empire, is one of the most ambitious constructions of the Hellenistic period. The syncretism of its pantheon, and the lineage of its kings, which can be traced back through two sets of legends, Greek and Persian, is evidence of the dual origin of this kingdom's culture.</p>

        <p>Çal Cave, situated in the Düzköy district of Trabzon, is a popular tourist destination that offers visitors a
            chance to explore one of the longest caves in the world, measuring approximately 2 kilometers in length.
            Located at an altitude of 1,050 meters above sea level, the cave features breathtaking stalactites,
            stalagmites, streams, waterfalls, and ponds that add to its natural beauty.
            The cave is divided into two sections, with the left side comprising a 150-meter long path and the right
            side spanning a 400-meter long course. Visitors can marvel at the stunning fault line in the ceiling and
            take photos of this unique feature. Additionally, the deeper parts of the cave, where stalactites and
            stalagmites abound, are believed to be beneficial for people suffering from respiratory problems such as
            asthma and shortness of breath.

            At around 200 meters from the entrance, the cave splits into two sides, both of which are accessible to
            visitors. The cave's accessible area, which is paved with wooden walkways, spans 8 kilometers. Visitors can
            enjoy the beautiful lake and waterfall at the 60th meter of the long arm, while the doline's water flows
            through the chimney at the end of the small arm. The cave, estimated to be approximately 8 million years
            old, is a true wonder of nature that has remained hidden from human sight for many ages.
